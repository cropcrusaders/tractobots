### Other Files
- `rosbridge_complete_solution.py` - No longer needed
- `simple_terminal_test.py` - No longer needed
- `simple_connection_test.py` - No longer needed
- `final_connection_test.py` - No longer needed

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Cleaner Project Root**: The project root directory is now cleaner and more focused.
2. **Better Organization**: All dashboard-related code is properly organized in dedicated directories.
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is easier to find and maintain with a proper directory structure.
4. **Reduced Confusion**: New developers can more easily understand the project structure.
5. **Smaller Repository Size**: Removing redundant files reduces the overall size of the repository.

## How Files Were Organized

- Main dashboard implementation moved to `dashboard/dashboard.py`
- Tests consolidated in `dashboard/tests/`
- Utilities organized in `dashboard/utils/`
- Helper scripts placed in `dashboard/scripts/`
- Documentation updated to reflect new structure

## Conclusion

This cleanup has significantly improved the organization and maintainability of the Tractobots project. The dashboard code is now properly structured and redundant files have been removed.
