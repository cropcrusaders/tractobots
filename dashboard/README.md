```

### Customization

The dashboard can be extended with additional features by modifying `dashboard.py`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Verify WSL is running: `wsl --status`
2. Check if ROS2 is installed: `wsl -e ls /opt/ros/jazzy`
3. Ensure port forwarding is set up: `netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4`
4. Start rosbridge manually: `wsl -e ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml`
